# express-graphql-react-authentication Starter

## Perfect starter for a any project with NodeJs, express, mongodb, GraphQL in the backend, and React, Apollo JS in the frontend

## Authentication is all done. Works with JWT tokens/refreshTokens. SignUp, login, logout, works as a charm. Includes Errors GraphQL side. Also validation in frontend.

### Setup: fill the .env file variables. Something like:

* NODE_ENV=development
* MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/nameofdb
* PORT=3000
* SECRET=mahsdASDHASKDaskdjasdAJSDAs
* SECRET2=ASDJASDJasDJQURJFIRWGJDgkjdthijdksjfs

### Client folder is inside the server with the name of authGraphQLStarter_Client. I did this just for easily upload this project to github. But you have to run both projects separately. Server side is only to handle GraphQL requests. I use Yarn for this, so open the terminal, go to Server folder and run yarn start. Then open a tab, go to Client folder, and also run yarn start.
